# Notes for Ch 3
An experiment is a procedure that results in one out of a number of possible outcomes.
An outcome is the result of an experiment.

The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.

Ex: Given a 6-sided die, rolling the die would be the experiment, and the result of the die would be the outcome
The set would be : S = {1,2,3,4,5,6};

Ex: Given a deck of 52 standard playing cards:
Drawing a random card from the deck: Experiment
Drawing a 3 of spades: outcome
Size of the same: 52

A subset of  the sample space is called an event.
Ex: For a die roll, the event A is rolling an even number. Therefore the event is the subset: A = {2,4,6}, which is 
a subset of the larger set of the sample space: {1,2,3,4,5,6}

An event can be further categorized into two more events:
	A compound event: A subset of the sample space consisting of more than one outcome.
			Ex: The event A = {2,4,6} is a compound event since rolling an event number consists of three outcomes.
	A simple event: A subset with a single outcome.
			Ex: The event C is rolling a 5 on the die. Thus, C = {5} is a simple event because C contains only 1 outcome.
	
	
  - Probability
  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur.
  The probability of event A is denoted P(A) and is the sum of the probabilities of each outcome in the event.
  Another def: Probability is the number of desired outcomes / the total number of outcomes in the sample space, assuming
  that all the outcomes are equally likely.
  Ex: if a coin is flipped, the probability that the coin turns up heads is 1 desired outcome of heads divided
  by 2 outcomes in the sample space (heads or tails) or 1 /2.
  
  However, the size of the sample space often cannot be counted or determined in a practical way, or the different outcomesare not
  equally likely.
  Thus, another definition of probability is: The relative frequency of the desired outcome, or the proportion of times the outcome
  will occur when the experiment is repeated an infinite number of times.
		Ex: if a coin is flipped many times, the frequency of heads will approach 1/2 over time. Thus the probability of 
		heads is 1/2.
