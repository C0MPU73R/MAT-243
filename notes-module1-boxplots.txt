[-12, -6, -2, 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11]

import pandas as pd
scores = pd.read_csv('') // ^
print(scores.describe())

med = 9 + 1 / 2 = 5, or element 5, which is 2.

therefore, the lower half of the sequence is: [-12, -6, -2, 0, 2]
and the upper half of the sequence is: [2, 5, 8, 10, 11]
//ok
For Q1, we take the median of the lower parsed sequence, which is -2
For Q3, we take the median of the upper parsed sequence, which is (8)
